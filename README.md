# RadioBot
A Discord bot that can control "radio stations" and do things like add songs to the station playlists, start stations and some other helpful little things.

## What is it?

A Discord bot that can create voice channels that act as "radio stations". It will stream audio from the internet
and play it through the voice channel. You can do things like add songs to the channel playlists, rename channels,
see what songs a channel has in its playlist. It uses sqlite3 to manage a database of all of the information that it stores.

It does other common things too, like get server statistics, connected member list, permissions (i think?)

Really, this bot had a lot of potential I think. I never finished it though.
